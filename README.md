# Robotic Arm Pick & Place Project

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
---
## Setting up the environment:

### initial install:
# Robotic arm - Pick & Place project

Make sure you are using robo-nd VM or have Ubuntu+ROS installed locally.

### One time Gazebo setup step:
Check the version of gazebo installed on your system using a terminal:
```sh
$ gazebo --version
```
To run projects from this repository you need version 7.7.0+
If your gazebo version is not 7.7.0+, perform the update as follows:
```sh
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
$ wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gazebo7
```

Once again check if the correct version was installed:
```sh
$ gazebo --version
```
### For the rest of this setup, catkin_ws is the name of active ROS Workspace, if your workspace name is different, change the commands accordingly

If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the **src** directory of your workspace:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project.git
```

Now from a terminal window:

```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts
$ sudo chmod +x target_spawn.py
$ sudo chmod +x IK_server.py
$ sudo chmod +x safe_spawner.sh
```
Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

Add following to your .bashrc file
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/models

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

For demo mode make sure the **demo** flag is set to _"true"_ in `inverse_kinematics.launch` file under /RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/launch

In addition, you can also control the spawn location of the target object in the shelf. To do this, modify the **spawn_location** argument in `target_description.launch` file under /RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/launch. 0-9 are valid values for spawn_location with 0 being random mode.

You can launch the project by
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts
$ ./safe_spawner.sh
```

If you are running in demo mode, this is all you need. To run your own Inverse Kinematics code change the **demo** flag described above to _"false"_ and run your code (once the project has successfully loaded) by:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts
$ rosrun kuka_arm IK_server.py
```
Once Gazebo and rviz are up and running, make sure you see following in the gazebo world:

	- Robot
	
	- Shelf
	
	- Blue cylindrical target in one of the shelves
	
	- Dropbox right next to the robot
	

If any of these items are missing, report as an issue.

Once all these items are confirmed, open rviz window, hit Next button.

To view the complete demo keep hitting Next after previous action is completed successfully. 

Since debugging is enabled, you should be able to see diagnostic output on various terminals that have popped up.

The demo ends when the robot arm reaches at the top of the drop location. 

There is no loopback implemented yet, so you need to close all the terminal windows in order to restart.

In case the demo fails, close all three terminal windows and rerun the script.

### Note
If errors occure when launching program try.
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/models

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```


### Forward Kinematic Analysis

### Kuka KR210 robot DH parameters.

```python
# DH Table
DH_Table = {alpha0:      0, a0:      0, d1:  0.75, q1:        q1,
            alpha1: -pi/2., a1:   0.35, d2:     0, q2: -pi/2.+q2,
            alpha2:      0, a2:   1.25, d3:     0, q3:        q3,
            alpha3: -pi/2., a3: -0.054, d4:  1.50, q4:        q4,
            alpha4:  pi/2., a4:      0, d5:     0, q5:        q5,
            alpha5: -pi/2., a5:      0, d6:     0, q6:        q6,
            alpha6:      0, a6:      0, d7: 0.303, q7:         0}
```

### Creating the individual transformation matrices about each joint:

```python
# Homogeneous transform matrix function

def TF_Mat(alpha, a, d, q):
    TF = Matrix([[            cos(q),           -sin(q),           0,             a],
                 [ sin(q)*cos(alpha), cos(q)*cos(alpha), -sin(alpha), -sin(alpha)*d],
                 [ sin(q)*sin(alpha), cos(q)*sin(alpha),  cos(alpha),  cos(alpha)*d],
                 [                 0,                 0,           0,             1]])
    return TF
```
Now we substitute the DH parameters into the transformation matrix: 

```python
   ## Substitute DH_Table
T0_1 = TF_Mat(alpha0, a0, d1, q1).subs(DH_table)
T1_2 = TF_Mat(alpha1, a1, d2, q2).subs(DH_table)
T2_3 = TF_Mat(alpha2, a2, d3, q3).subs(DH_table)
T3_4 = TF_Mat(alpha3, a3, d4, q4).subs(DH_table)
T4_5 = TF_Mat(alpha4, a4, d5, q5).subs(DH_table)
T5_6 = TF_Mat(alpha5, a5, d6, q6).subs(DH_table)
T6_EE = TF_Mat(alpha6, a6, d7, q7).subs(DH_table)

```
rotation correction URDF versus DH Convention: 180 degree rotation on the Z axis, and -90 degree on the y axis

```python
rz = Matrix([[-1, 0,0, 0],
             [0, -1, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 1, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 1]])
             
ry = Matrix([[0, 0, -1, 0],
             [0, 1, 0, 0],
             [1, 0, 0, 0], 
             [0, 0, 0, 1]])


R_corr = (R_z * R_y)

T_total= (T0_EE * R_corr)
```


## Inverse Kinematics Analysis


### Inverse Position

Collect the end-effector position(**Px, Py, Pz**) and orientation (**Roll, Pitch, Yaw**) from system
```python
    # Requested end-effector (EE) position
    px = req.poses[x].position.x
    py = req.poses[x].position.y
    pz = req.poses[x].position.z
      
    # Requested end-effector (EE) orientation
    (roll,pitch,yaw) = tf.transformations.euler_from_quaternion(
        [req.poses[x].orientation.x,
         req.poses[x].orientation.y,
         req.poses[x].orientation.z,
         req.poses[x].orientation.w])
```

We substitute the obtained roll, pitch and yaw in the final rotation matrix.

```python
 # determine EE rotation matrix RPY (Roll, Pitch, Yaw)
    r = symbols('r')
    p = symbols('p')
    y = symbols('y')

    # Roll
    Rot_X = Matrix([[       1,       0,       0],
                    [       0,  cos(r), -sin(r)],
                    [       0,  sin(r),  cos(r)]])
    # Pitch
    Rot_Y = Matrix([[  cos(p),       0,  sin(p)],
                    [       0,       1,       0],
                    [ -sin(p),       0,  cos(p)]])
    # Yaw
    Rot_Z = Matrix([[  cos(y), -sin(y),       0],
                    [  sin(y),  cos(y),       0],
                    [       0,       0,       1]])

    Rot_EE = Rot_Z * Rot_Y * Rot_X
    
    # apply rotation correction 
    Rot_EE = ROT_EE * R_corr
    
    # End effector final rotation matrix
    Rot_EE = ROT_EE.subs({'r': roll, 'p': pitch, 'y': yaw})
```
we begin the steps to calculate **ùúÉ1, ùúÉ2 and ùúÉ3**

```python
    # n-vectors from EE rotation matrix
    nx = Rot_EE[0,2]
	  ny = Rot_EE[1,2]
	  nz = Rot_EE[2,2]
    
    # Calculate Wrest Center
    d6 = 0 # d6 value from DH_Table
	  l = 0.303	    
	  wcx = px - (d6 + l) * nx
	  wcy = py - (d6 + l) * ny
	  wcz = pz - (d6 + l) * nz
```

```python
    # Theta1 formula
    theta1 = atan2(wcy,wcx)
```
Using cosine laws SSS from trigonometry, we can calculate **ùúÉ2 and ùúÉ3**. 

```python
    #triangle sides for theta2 and theta3
    side_a = 1.501 
	  side_b = sqrt(pow((sqrt(wcx * wcx + wcy * wcy) - 0.35), 2) + pow((wcz - 0.75), 2))
    side_c = 1.25
    
    # SSS angles
    angle_a = acos((pow(side_b, 2) + pow(side_c, 2) - pow(side_a, 2))/(2*side_b*side_c))
	  angle_b = acos((pow(side_c, 2) + pow(side_a, 2) - pow(side_b, 2))/(2*side_c*side_a))
    
    # Theta2 and Theta3 formulas
	  theta2 = pi/2 - angle_a - atan2(wcz - 0.75, sqrt(wcx * wcx + wcy * wcy) - 0.35)
	  theta3 = pi/2 - (angle_b + 0.036)
    
``` 

### Inverse Orientation

Next we need to determining the homogeneous rotaion matrix from link_3 to gripper_link. The R3_6 matrix will be used to find values of the final three joint variables **ùúÉ4, ùúÉ5 and ùúÉ6**.
```python
    # Homogeneous rotation matrix from base_link to link_3 
    R0_3 = T0_1[0:3,0:3] * T1_2[0:3,0:3] * T2_3[0:3,0:3]
    
    # Evaluate the matrix using the previous calculated theta values
	  R0_3 = R0_3.evalf(subs ={q1: theta1, q2: theta2, q3: theta3})
    
    # Multiplying the transpose of R0_3 with Rot_EE gives us the final homogeneous rotation matrix
    # Note: using an inverse matrix function created a large error which was resolved using a transpose function
	  R3_6 = R0_3.transpose() * Rot_EE

```python
     # **ùúÉ4, ùúÉ5 and ùúÉ6** formulas
     theta5 = atan2(sqrt(R3_6[0,2]*R3_6[0,2] + R3_6[2,2]*R3_6[2,2]),R3_6[1,2]  
     theta4 = atan2(R3_6[2,2], -R3_6[0,2]) 
     theta6 = atan2(-R3_6[1,1],R3_6[1,0])
```
